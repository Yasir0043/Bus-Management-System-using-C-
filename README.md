In this Bus Management System, Tree Data Structure is used for randomly access of the  desired location. In this project one structure is created which hold the all attributes required  for in seat reservation such as seat number, client name, client id, client phone number and  travel location. In order to check the already reserved seats check function search through all  the tree to find the matched seat, if it finds the same seat number in the tree it will display  that “Seat is already reserved” if not it will call the child reservation function in order to  reserve that seat.
